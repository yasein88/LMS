**Project Name: Library Management System - Database Design**<br />

**Description:**<br />
This project provides a complete database design for a Library Management System, including three essential database models:<br />

Conceptual Model (ER Diagram) â€“ Represents entities, relationships, and key attributes.<br />
Logical Model â€“ Converts the conceptual design into tables, columns, primary keys, and foreign keys.<br />
Physical Model â€“ Defines database-specific implementations, including data types, constraints, and indexing.<br />
The system is designed to track books, members, loans, and publishers, ensuring efficient book borrowing, member management, and reporting functionalities.<br />

**Features:**<br />
âœ” Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)<br />
âœ” Normalized Database Schema (3NF)<br />
âœ” SQL-Compatible Table Structures<br />
âœ” Foreign Key Constraints for Data Integrity<br />
âœ” Indexing for Performance Optimization<br />

**Files Included:**<br />
ðŸ“Œ LMS_Use_Case.pdf - System Initial Description<br />
ðŸ“Œ er_diagram.drawio.png - Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram<br />
ðŸ“Œ logical_diagram.drawio.png - Logical Model Schema<br />
ðŸ“Œ physical_diagram.drawio.png - Physical Model Schema<br />
ðŸ“Œ LMS Database Design.drawio - file containing all diagrams working on draw.io<br />

**Tools Used:**<br />
Diagramming: Draw.io<br />
Database Management Systems (DBMS): MySQL<br />

**How to Use:**<br />
Download the LMS Database Design.drawio file.<br />
Review the ER Diagram to understand the high-level structure.<br />
Check the Logical Model for a normalized schema.<br />
Implement the Physical Model in a chosen DBMS using the defined table structures.<br />
Feel free to contribute, improve, or expand the database model to fit additional requirements! ðŸš€<br />
