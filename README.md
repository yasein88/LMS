**Project Name: Library Management System - Database Design**

**Description:**
This project provides a complete database design for a Library Management System, including three essential database models:

Conceptual Model (ER Diagram) â€“ Represents entities, relationships, and key attributes.
Logical Model â€“ Converts the conceptual design into tables, columns, primary keys, and foreign keys.
Physical Model â€“ Defines database-specific implementations, including data types, constraints, and indexing.
The system is designed to track books, members, loans, and publishers, ensuring efficient book borrowing, member management, and reporting functionalities.

**Features:**
âœ” Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)
âœ” Normalized Database Schema (3NF)
âœ” SQL-Compatible Table Structures
âœ” Foreign Key Constraints for Data Integrity
âœ” Indexing for Performance Optimization

**Files Included:**
ðŸ“Œ LMS_Use_Case.pdf - System Initial Description
ðŸ“Œ er_diagram.drawio.png - Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram
ðŸ“Œ logical_diagram.drawio.png - Logical Model Schema
ðŸ“Œ physical_diagram.drawio.png - Physical Model Schema
ðŸ“Œ LMS Database Design.drawio - file containing all diagrams working on draw.io

**Tools Used:**
Diagramming: Draw.io
Database Management Systems (DBMS): MySQL

**How to Use:**
Download the LMS Database Design.drawio file.
Review the ER Diagram to understand the high-level structure.
Check the Logical Model for a normalized schema.
Implement the Physical Model in a chosen DBMS using the defined table structures.
Feel free to contribute, improve, or expand the database model to fit additional requirements! ðŸš€
